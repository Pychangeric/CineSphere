## Project Description
CineSphere is a movie lover's paradise. It appeals to movie lovers everywhere by providing the kind of functionality that fans want. 
Users are able to use the search feature to look up their favorite movies across different genres at which point CineSphere then provides them with 
additional content associated with those movies; things like movie trailers and synopses. The app also allows users to like movies 
as well as add them to their favorites list. Future plans include allowing fans to download movies directly off the site and an increased 
breadth of content such as music and much more!
